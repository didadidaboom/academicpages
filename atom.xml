    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="About-me"><a href="#About-me" class="headerlink" title="About me"></a>About me</h1><p>Over the last half year, <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/didadidaboom">Wu Chong</a> has shifted his focus to his interest areas of data analysis, AI algorithms, and recommender systems without hurrying up to work and also exploring the internet area in view of a full stack developer. To reach these goals, he accessed some open projects (黑马头条, etc.), which primarily relate to frameworks, such as Hadoop, Hive, Spark, SQL, PyTorch, etc. Meanwhile, he also started his own project “<a href="https://github.com/didadidaboom/bkmist">BKMIST</a>“, a social community released as a mini-program in Wechat, to let himself experience how a full-stack developer should do and think. His connection with the internet area goes checking more <a href="/academicpages/#Internet-Experiences">here</a>.</p><p>He made his decision to withdraw from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) at the end of the year 2021. Before that, he passed QE (<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sbs/admissions/programmes/graduate/research/programme-and-curriculum/ph.d.-candidature-confirmation-(qe)">qualifying examination</a>) and was named as a Ph.D. candidate, supervised by <a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00198">Asst Prof Chan Wai Lee</a>, working on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that requires the abilities to acquire programming languages quickly and to explore different open source frameworks. He obtained his degree of M.E. in 2018 from the School of Energy and Power Engineering at Beihang University with his work in the CFD area. He received his degree of B.E. from Nanchang Hangkong University in 2014.</p><h1 id="News"><a href="#News" class="headerlink" title="News"></a>News</h1><ul><li>2022-08-09: completed all infomation.</li><li>2022-08-08: started personal academic page</li><li>2022-02-03: withdrawl was allowed, (<a href="https://didadidaboom.github.io/academicpages/attaches/withdrawalfrom.pdf">found here</a>)</li><li>2021-12-01: applied to withdraw from NTU</li><li>2019-11-25: 72nd Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, (<a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD19/Session/P41.4">found here</a>)</li></ul><h1 id="Interest-Areas"><a href="#Interest-Areas" class="headerlink" title="Interest Areas"></a>Interest Areas</h1><ul><li>Data Engineer</li><li>Machine Learning Engineer (PyTorch and Hadoop)</li><li>Spark Engineer</li><li>Bigdata Engineer (Hadoop)</li></ul><h1 id="Internet-Project-Experiences"><a href="#Internet-Project-Experiences" class="headerlink" title="Internet Project Experiences"></a>Internet Project Experiences</h1><ul><li><p>2022.07-2022.07  Build Hadoop Ecosystem Cluster with <strong>Docker</strong></p><p>(Wrote a Dockerfile to wrap Hadoop components, which can be used to construct the recommender system; Docker found by searching Dockerhub ID: didadidaboom; and docker file found at <a href="https://github.com/didadidaboom">GitHub</a> )</p></li><li><p>2022.03-2022.06  Learnt <strong>neural networks</strong> theory systematically and practiced it by <strong>PyTorch</strong></p><p>(Lead all the processes from <strong>data collection, cleaning, and pre-processing, to training models</strong>, including Multilayer DNN, TrialNet, and Gan; Followed a paper and wrote its corresponding algorithm. <a href="https://github.com/didadidaboom/NeuralNetwork-Practices">Found here</a> )</p></li><li><p>2022.02-2022.03  Repeated an open project - “Recommend System: 黑马头条”</p><p>(Practiced <strong>Hadoop ecosystem</strong> and its components, including <strong>Hadoop, Hive, Yarn, Sqoop, and Spark</strong>; Learned how the recommender algorithms developed from item-based and user-based recommendation to model-based recommendation.
